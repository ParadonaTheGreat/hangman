# Hangman

## How to Play

This app is a rendition of the classic hangman. The app chooses a random word from almost 70,000 words. It then allows the user to guess, updating the hangman accordingly. After the game ends, whether by the user running out of guesses or correctly guessing the word, the user is brought to a game over screen with the ability to restart. 

## Project

This app was made in Android Studio. The game screen and game over screen are 2 separate activities. There is a separate class the app uses to select a word from the text file of all the words.
